## You need to switch to a mode/mindset for doing things!##

## You need a crystal clear goal! Even when you are young!##

## Everything becomes a pathway to lead to your goal! The world is your library! ##

## Goal list! Kill list! Who is better than you? Which company is better in the industry! ##

## You need to get emotionally and mentally strong, stop worry about how other people think of you! It's not about you! ##

## Stay disipline! Be persistent! ##

## Dealing with kids, work life balance is hard, but that's not excuse! Nothing is excuse! When you go above and beyond, that's what drive you and make you! ##

## Pain is what makes you! Pain is not defing you!##

## Setting example is hard! especially for kids! But it will be good! ##
